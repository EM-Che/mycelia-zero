This is a work in progress. Not yet ready for developer release.

No automatic installation of dependencies yet.

Hook up a Brother QL-570 thermal label printer.

Edit config file: config.js

Start webserver: ./server.js

Start print service: ./printservice.js

Browse to http://localhost:3000/

If you don't want to use the print service (e.g. during development), you can bypass it by setting config.printer.direct = true, in config.js.
