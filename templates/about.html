  Mycelia Zero is version 0 of the decentralized Mycelia software. 
</p>

<p>
It is in part a rewrite of Labitrack v2, and in part a precursor to Mycelia. It is the bridge between Labitrack and Mycelia.</p>

<p>The goal is to switch Labitrack over to the core technologies of Mycelia (CouchDB, node.js and ElasticSearch), while adding only a few features to the Labitrack software (primarily simple access level differentation and centralized aggregation).</p>
